gcc xx.c -fPIC -shared -o xx.so

-fPIC : 去掉和地址偏移相关的代码.
If supported for the target machine, emit position-independent code, suitable for dynamic linking and avoiding any limit on the size of the
global offset table.  This option makes a difference on the m68k, PowerPC and SPARC.

Position-independent code requires special support, and therefore works only on certain machines.

-shared :
创建共享lib,需要配合-fPIC的设置
Produce a shared object which can then be linked with other objects to form an executable.  Not all systems support this option.  For pre-
dictable results, you must also specify the same set of options that were used to generate code (-fpic, -fPIC, or model suboptions) when you
specify this option.[1]
